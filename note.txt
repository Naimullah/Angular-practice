what is data binding ?
Data binding in Angular allows us to communicate btw a component class and its coresponding view template.
class component -----------> HTML view
1. One way data binding is when we can access a component class property in its corresponding view template

String Interpolation  {{}}
Property Binding:
1. is used binding to bind the property of an HTML element to the property or method of a component class 
Property Binding[property]=data  
<div class="header">
    <div class="site-image">
        <img [src]="source" height="240" width="320">
    </div>
    <div class="site-slogan">
        <h2>{{slogan}}</h2>
        <h2>{{getSlogan()}}</h2>
    </div>
</div>
export class HeaderComponent {
slogan:string="Your one stop shop";
source:string="/assets/images.jpg";
getSlogan(){
  return 'This is new Slogan for application';
}
}

Event binding : allows us to bind webpage events to a component property or method using event binding we can pass data from
view to component 
Event Binding (data)="expression"
Two way data Binding  go to app.module.ts import the form module FormModule ngModel
<!-- Two binding -->
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="searchValue">
Directives are simply an instruction to the DOM
types of drective 
1. structural directive: changes the view of a webpage by adding or removing DOM element from webpage
2. Attribute Directive: Used like an attribute on a existing webpage element to change its look and behaviour.
ngFOr Drectives?
1.THe ngFor directive is used to repeat a portion of HTML template once per each item from an itterable list
2.THe ngFor is a structureal directive that means ngFor manipulates the DOM by adding or removing elements from the DOM
<div *ngFor="let item of [1,2,3,4]">
    <p>THis the number :{{item}}</p>
</div>
ngStyle  is an attribute directive. that means ngStyle chabge the look and behaviour of an HTML element 
1. the ngStyle directive is used to set a CSS style dynamically for an HTML element based on a given typescript expression 
<div [ngStyle]="{color:p.available=='Available' ? 'Green' : 'Red'}">{{p.available}}</div>
ngIf Directive : the ngIf is a structural directive 
1. the ngIf directive is used to add or remove element from a webpage based on a given condition  <span *ngIf="searchValue !=''">You Search for {{searchValue}}</span>
ngClass Directive is an attribute directive, the ngClass directive is used to add a CSS class dynamically to webpage element
  
Custom Componet : W CAN PASS DATA FROM PARENT COMPONENT TO CHILD COMPONENT AND VICE VERSA. WE USE @INPUT & @OUTPUT DECORATOR for that
1. We can pass data from component class to view template and vice cersa using property binding string interoplation and event binding
